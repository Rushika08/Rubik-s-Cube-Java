# Rubic-Cube-Java
Solving the Rubic Cube using Java

This is an assignment where the 3-by-3-by-3 rubic cube is solved based on user
input via keyboard. A 3x3x3 rubic cube is built with 26 pieces which is visible to the outside and
one center unit which holds all the pieces to gather. Assign Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, White, and Orange to six sides of the cube. A one side has 1
center piece, four corner pieces with 3 surfaces, and four edge pieces with two surfaces. All the surfaces with same color comes to one surface when rubic cube is solved. In this quest, produce a function to shuffle the cube. After sufling, cube pieces should randomly
located in the cube. User can enter which layer to rotate with following commands in the console. Command Rotating direction
U+ Top layer is rotated in clockwise direction
U- Top layer is rotated in anti-clockwise direction
B+ Bottom layer is rotated in clockwise direction
B- Bottom layer is rotated in anti-clockwise direction
R+ Right hand side layer is rotated clockwise direction
R- Right hand side layer is rotated anti-clockwise direction
L+ Right hand side layer is rotated clockwise direction
L- Right hand side layer is rotated anti-clockwise direction
F+ Front face is rotated clockwise direction
F- Front face is rotated anti-clockwise direction
